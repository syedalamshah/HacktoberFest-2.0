## üöÄ Projects Overview

This submission includes the three required projects. Each project lives in its own folder beneath this team submission directory.

Folder structure (example):

```
./Submissions/Team_JUNOON/
‚îú‚îÄ Prediction-Patient-Hospital-Readmission/
‚îú‚îÄ Prediction-for-Smart-Agriculture-Machine-Failure/
‚îî‚îÄ inventroy-sales-management-system/
```

| Project # | Project Title |
|----------:|----------------|
| 1 | Inventory And Sales Management System (
|   | path: `./Prediction-Patient-Hospital-Readmission`) |

|   | path: `./Prediction-for-Smart-Agriculture-Machine-Failure`) |

Notes:

## Solved Issues

### 1. Failure Prediction for Smart Agricultural Equipment Using Sensor Data (Issue #1)
**Domain:** Data Science / AI / ML  
**Description:**  
We developed a predictive model to identify potential failures in smart agricultural equipment based on sensor data. The project leverages machine learning techniques to monitor and forecast equipment health, enabling preventive maintenance and reducing downtime.

**Key Contributions:**
- Collected and preprocessed sensor data from agricultural machinery.  
- Built and trained a predictive model using Random Forest and other ensemble methods.  
- Evaluated the model for accuracy and reliability in failure prediction.

### 2. Predicting Patient Hospital Readmission Risk (Issue #2)
**Domain:** Data Science / AI / ML  
**Description:**  
This project predicts the likelihood of a patient being readmitted to the hospital using historical medical records and patient data. The goal is to optimize healthcare management and reduce unnecessary readmissions.

**Key Contributions:**
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling missing values.  
- Applied classification algorithms to predict readmission risk.  
- Generated actionable insights for healthcare providers to manage patient care proactively.

### 3. E‑Commerce Store Scenario (Issue #11)
**Domain:** Competitive Programming / DSA  
**Description:**  
We designed algorithms to simulate key operations of an e-commerce platform, including inventory management, product search, and order processing. The focus was on optimizing data structures and algorithms to improve performance and efficiency.

**Key Contributions:**
- Implemented efficient data structures for product catalog and user cart management.  
- Developed algorithms for real-time inventory tracking and order fulfillment.  
- Tested solutions against multiple scenarios to ensure correctness and performance.

## Hackathon Outcome
- Successfully solved **3 issues** from the HacktoberFest-2.0 repository.  
- Demonstrated collaborative teamwork with clear role distribution.  
- Applied a mix of **Data Science, Machine Learning, and DSA** skills to real-world and simulated problems.

---

## Future Work
- Extend the predictive models for agricultural equipment and hospital readmission to include real-time streaming data.  
- Enhance the e-commerce algorithms with additional features like recommendation systems and analytics dashboards.  
- Share solutions as reusable modules for the open-source community.
